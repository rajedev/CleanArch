# Clean Arch

It is for the learning reference, here i have implemented the below things.

- Clean Architecture - Multi-Module
- ViewModel
- Coroutine & Flow API
- Hilt for DI
- Version Catalog
- Network Calls with various APIs (Pokemon, Feed, Free2Game, Quotes) - Retrofit & KtoR (engine: okhttp) (How dynamically handles both at run time).  As i mentioned it earlier this repo is not specific to the feature, it has a code for all my try-outs.
- Kotlinx Serialization JSON

Need to update:
- Compose UI
- Material 3
- etc...
